# X-SlickGrid Web Component

The X-Slick-Grid tag is a W3C compliant (version 0, for now) custom element, which provides a convenient wrapper around the [x-slick-grid grid library] (http://ddomingues.com/X-SlickGrid/), 
which in turn is a fork of dormant [slickgrid] (https://github.com/mleibman/SlickGrid/wiki) library.  Like the base slickgrid, the component has as a dependency JQuery and Jquery UI.  

Currently, the X-Slick-Grid also depends on [Polymer] (https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/) for providing facilities for structuring the web component.  The component works with IE11+, as well as other 
tested evergreen browsers (Edge, Chrome, Safari.
